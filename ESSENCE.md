### The Group's Current State
We believe we are at the beginning of the "Working well" stage, as we cannot yet check the `The team naturally applies the practices without consciously thinking about them.` checkbox. 

The biggest obstacle in this assignment was understanding how to present the different steps in a way that would not conflict with one another. We have made most of our improvements in collaboration and communication, as these are the main skills we have consistently practised on each assignment. To reach the next state, we would have to have "more time on the horse", but given that each assignment is almost a new horse in some ways, there is a significant adjustment period.
